# Introduction
Now we will expand on the lessons from the first part of the workshop and apply the skills we learned to the recent COVID-19 data which has been curated by the Johns Hopkins University Centor fo Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE). We will recreate some of the data they made with their [Tableau dashboard](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) from the [raw data available on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UF2pSkFTURko2OvfHWWlFpDFAr1UxCBA4JLwlSP6KFo/edit?usp=sharing) or [GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).  For the purposes of this workshop I took the data from 2020-02-10 and cleaned it (the code used to clean the data is in the 03.Rmd file) so we could focus on learning the concepts.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggsci)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- read_csv("COVID19.csv")

data
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data %>% 
  glimpse()

data %>% 
  dim()
```

Let's try to see if we can aggregate the data similar to the Tableau dashboard.  We can use the `group_by()`, `summarize()`, and `arrange()` functions to add up all the confirmed cases by country.

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(Confirmed_no)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total))
```

Let's try to visualize the data!  First, we will have to aggregate the data using `group_by()` and `summarize()`.

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(Location, Date) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(Confirmed_no)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = total, color = Location)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_nejm()
``` 





Which Province in China has the most confirmed cases on 2020-02-10?  
```{r}
